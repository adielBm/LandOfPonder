### *Remembrance of Earth's Past* Trilogy [Fiction]
The science fiction trilogy consists of *The Three Body Problem*, *The Dark Forest* and *Death's End*.
##### The Three Body Problem
A spectacular Science Fiction novel. I do not wish to describe its plot, as I don't wish to spoil this breathtaking novel.

However, I do wish to detail a few topics the book addresses: science, communication, what is truth, the role of the academy, physics, human progress, and computing.

The plot may at first be peculiar, yet it soon becomes addictive. Then everything gets pieced together into a magnificent formation. The story regularly addresses many issues of life, as if the author is a true genius (which I think he is).

The book is strongly recommended for ones interested in Science Fiction or in one of the abovementioned topics.

##### The Dark Forest
As the sequel to *The Three-Body Problem*, it keeps up and even challenges the beauty of its predecessor. The book is full of silent wisdom, much like its predecessor, with an astonishing demonstration of new concepts and plot. The plot interlaces awe-inspiring landscapes, which I found to be delicate delights of imagination. As to the plot, nothing can express my opinion but the fact that I found myself self-exclaiming several times while reading,  in shock: *How is that possible?! No way! This is ingenious!!*

##### Death's End
The final book expands the scale of the plot even further. Remember to reflect on the first chapter upon finishing the book.

### The Code Book [Nonfiction]
The book covers the history of Cryptography.
The Code Book offers a survey of the prominent events in the story of Cryptography, from ancient times to WW1 and WW2 and as far as modern Cryptography.
The book surveys the historical events, giving the relevant historical background and describing the cryptographic algorithms, and does so fluently. 
I was particularly astonished by the clarity of the explanation of Quantum Cryptography.
The book places a cryptographic perspective on major events of history and emphasizes the effect that cryptography has on the course of history.

A great read for everyone interested in Cryptography, and especially for ones interested in History and Theoretical Computer Science.
