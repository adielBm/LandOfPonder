There are several misconceptions regarding the benefits of earning a High-School diploma, aka *Bagrut*. Here I explain them and give my opinionated analysis.

*Note that all written isn't calling for action, this scribe merely contains my opinion as always. Further note that what's written is written by a person with certain qualities and shortcomings: bad memorization ability, interested in specific STEM subjects, and a good independent learner.*

### Introduction
The *Bagrut* is the Israeli High-School diploma, which encapsulates assessments of various subjects, STEM and non-STEM alike. One learns for the Bagrut for three years (grades 10-12). The Bagrut traditionally was a metric for evaluation for admission to various institutes, mainly academic institutions but also the IDF. However, the status of the Bagrut as a key factor of evaluation has declined in recent decades. There were many contributing factors to this trend. An example is the inflation of Bagrut diplomas and their grades (search the web for more information regarding the matter).

Earning a Bagrut, like any other choice in life, must be a choice based on the benefits it encapsulates as compared to the investment it demands. A Bagrut is an *investment* of three years, and one should assess its potential *yields*. There are two abundantly claimed yields of the Bagrut that I wish to disqualify: the *Intellectual Yield* and the *Practical Yield*.

### First Claim: The Intellectual Yield
The *Intellectual Yield* claims as follows:

>*In the process of earning a Bagrut, the student is introduced to a variety of subjects. The student comes out wiser, earning wide general knowledge regarding many fields of study, STEM and non-STEM alike: Math, History, Literature, English, and others. This knowledge critically helps the student later in civilian life.*

While it may be true for the short term, the intellectual contribution doesn't hold in the long term. Many of the *humanistic* subjects teach in a manner entitled *the 'swallow and vomit' technique*: memorising information before the examination, and later forgetting all about it. 
\
&emsp; Although forgetting isn't dictated by the system, it is only natural to so many students. You are invited to conduct a little experiment: ask your family members about the percentage of knowledge they still possess from their high-school history classes, and if they can recall the list of human rights.

Subjects that one forgets about after studying them are called *perishable*. Although the dichotomy between perishable and non-perishable subjects is different from student to student, two things are certain: 
1. For many (if not most) students *the vast majority* of subjects are perishable, with only a handful being non-perishable fields of study.
2. The long-term intellectual yield doesn't exist in perishable subjects.

Hence, the discussion of intellectual yield is moved to non-perishable subjects only.
\
&emsp; For many students, these subjects are subjects that intrigue them, subjects that interest them in their free time. **Students who are truly interested in a subject don't count on school to teach it to them.**
\
&emsp; This is induced by many factors, but mainly because school is confining by nature: school syllabus is limited and may not fit, school progresses through the material slowly, examinations and assignments are mandatory, and other subjective factors. 
\
&emsp; These self-taught students don't need school to feed their enthusiasm. This in effect dramatically reduces the potential intellectual yield even in non-perishable subjects.

Therefore, the overall intellectual yield is significantly smaller than what is claimed by many.

### Second Claim: The Practical Yield
Although knowledge should be considered more important than certificates, it mostly isn't in today's society. The *Practical Yield* of the Bagrut is hereinafter expressed:
>*You cannot manage in society without Bagrut. Only troublesome people don't possess a Bagrut, and this isn't a first impression you wish to convey to society. People won't hire you, because they think you are useless with no Bagrut. The army won't look at you, because people without Bagrut are untamed beings incapable of getting along with authority. The academia won't let you in, because you must have a Bagrut for preliminary knowledge. So long as you don't have 'Full Bagrut' written in your cv, all doors are slammed shut.*

The claim may seem exaggerated, yet people do possess it in one form or another. It contains several arguments: about the general *Labour Market*, the *Army*, and the *Academia*, to be now refuted.

#### Dismantlement #1: The General Labour Market
In today's era, employers look for the ability to perform the desired job. As long as one is evaluated favorably as to his means to achieve those tasks, one is considered a viable candidate. 
\
&emsp; Requirement for Bagrut is vastly obsolete among the generally-lusted professions (e.g. 'High-Tech'), but also in the general job marketplace. Including Bagrut inside of a CV only shows you have nothing else to fill the CV with, and this is done only in desperate attempts to make your CV less desolate. Candidates with relevant experience and knowledge do the recruiter a favor and omit the Bagrut from their CV. 
\
&emsp; You may look at example CVs of people working the professions you look up to and see that none contain 'Full Bagrut, 5pt English Math and History'. An example of easily obtained CVs are those of professors and researchers, e.g. see the Weizmann Institute's researchers.

#### Dismantlement #2: The Military
Regarding military service, the army at first makes some filtering based on the Bagrut status, but that's it. Even this filtering may not be carried out on certain occasions of outstanding skills and achievements. Later decisions are made through technical and non-technical interviews, exams etc. Certainly, the importance of Bagrut grades relative to personal performance varies across different roles, but even so, the IDF tends to favor their own evaluations. As an example of Bagrut's irrelevance in some cases, I share a friend's experience: 
>*In a cyber-related post-interview, my interviewers asked about school. I told them that I didn't attend high school and went for a full BSc at OUI. As to account for a potential strike regarding me not having a Bagrut, I further added that I wished to acquire the Bagrut in the later stages of my degree before enlistment. The interviewers replied "But why do that? You will already have obtained a BSc by that time, it isn't rational to do so! Bagrut is useless for you..." Amazed by their reply, I said "Because my grandma is worried", we all laughed and the interview went on (fun fact, I got accepted).*

In terms of military service, Bagrut isn't a huge factor for ones with good abilities relevant to their desired positions. The Bagrut tends to get easily overshadowed by related experience and academic achievements.

#### Dismantlement #3: The Academia
When it comes to Academia, Bagrut isn't a must. One can attend OUI, even during high school. After OUI, possibilities are countless, as indicated by the rich alumni of OUI: the various young students working in High-Tech before enlistment, the numerous soldiers (and veterans) of technological units, people in the industry who get to enter it in early stages of their degree thanks to the openness of OUI, graduate students in top-tier Israeli universities (many of whom are Academia in High-School alumni), and professors in the academia, are just a few to mention.
\
&emsp; Additionally, universities by no means require a Bagrut for graduate-studies admission: the mere requirement is a BSc. Any further requirements do not include a Bagrut. In general, academic institutions pay attention to Bagrut only when undergraduate studies are concerned. The Bagrut isn't a factor even during undergraduate studies. For instance, universities occasionally offer special summer programs for undergraduates of all Israeli universities, and such programs don't make the faintest glance over your Bagrut, but over your grades transcript at the university.

### Conclusions
Certainly, there are benefits of pursuing a Bagrut. Yet, as presented in this scribe, the alleged *Intellectual Yield* and *Practical Yield* of the Bagrut don't hold water in their prevalent form: 
* Most of the learned material learned as part of the Bagrut is thereafter forgotten;
* Bagrut isn't as fateful for admission to institutions as claimed by many.
