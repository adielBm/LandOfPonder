Learning about the characteristics of a course before taking it is beneficial, in my opinion. How intensive it is, what preliminaries are helpful, and, most importantly, how enjoyable a course is, are just a few insightful attributes. During my studies, I often searched for such information about the courses I was about to take, yet never found such a source that was written by a student similar to me: a young, Academia in Highschool student.

Such similarity is, as I learned along the way, quite relevant. That’s because young students often don’t have the full highschool preliminary knowledge as more mature students have. 

After having completed my Computer Science degree at OUI before enlistment, I gained many insights, that I wish to share in this folder, from one young student to another. This folder contains my insights regarding some of the courses that I took in my degree. I tried to only include beneficial, non-biodegradable information. Hence ’dry data’ about the courses, which may change, are, for example, emitted. Note that the reviews are *opinionated* – a fact that wouldn’t be noted along, for convenience.
