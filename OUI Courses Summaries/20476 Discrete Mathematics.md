# Discrete Mathematics [20476]

**About.** A lightweight course that deals with important results from *Set Theory*, *Combinatorics* and *Graph Theory*. It takes Ashnav's material on infinite cardinality further, developing mathematics that sets different infinite cardinalities apart (e.g. $\mathbb{R}$'s and $\mathbb{N}$'s cardinality), and even defines an order between such cardinalities. 

For example, we intuitively understand from Ashnav that $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{N}$ have the same infinite cardinality, as they are equinumerous. It was also noted in Ashnav that the two sets aren't equinumerous to $\mathbb{R}$. The cardinalities of the three sets are all infinite, yet one cardinality ($|\mathbb{R}| =\aleph$) is 'bigger' than another ($|\mathbb{Z}| =|\mathbb{N}| =\aleph _0$).

It lays the basics for future algorithmic courses with concepts from Graph Theory, with the introduction of several types of graphs, problems with graphs, and properties of graphs.

The topics from Combinatorics are as well used in many other courses, for counting many kinds of objects.

This course is important because of the use of its material in many other courses. Although these subjects will briefly be taught in each course, the depth of this course gives adequate confidence with later courses' preliminaries.

**My experience.** The course was fun, especially the combinatorics part of it. It was like solving puzzles, counting all sorts of odd objects. 

The concept of ordered infinite cardinalities fascinated and shocked me: how could one infinite be bigger than another? It amazed me how such results could be formalized into valid math.

The Graphs chapter confused me at first -- the objects seemed strange to me. It took a bit of time to comprehend it all. It also was the hardest topic to prepare for the exam.

The books were great (excluding the book on Combinatorics, which was ok).


**Preliminaries.** Ashanv was very helpful to me. I believe that certain students will be fine without it, but Ashnav and this course have several overlapping topics, mainly in Set Theory.

**Personal Note.** I did reference the course's books at a few later courses, so keep them.
